# mailmapbuilder

Automatically build .mailmap for a git repository

## Introduciton
[.mailmap](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitmailmap) is used to map author and committer names and email addresses to canonical real names and email addresses. 
With mailmapbuilder, the .mailmap file can be automatically built.

## How it works
It uses the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/quickstart) and the [commit history](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History)
to build the .mailmap:
- Extract developers names and emails from the commit hisotry
- Use the [GitHub Search Uesr API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/search#search-users) and developer name as the parameter to search the developer's GitHub personal page
- Select the top searched result as the candidate
- Extract the developer's login and public email from the candidate
- Use the login, public email to search in the commit history to collect the develoepr's aliases and emails in a chained way
